# Final manual QA

Everything a person has to check by hand, because a test cannot. The
automated suites cover the rules; this covers whether the thing is
usable.

Run it against a deployed address, not localhost, before saying TAMS is
ready. Tick as you go.

**Before you start:** five accounts, one per role, all signed in in
separate windows. Remember that staff sessions end after 30 minutes idle
and residents' after 60.

- [ ] An audit entry cannot be edited or deleted

## Security boundaries

Check these **against the database**, not by looking for a hidden button.
Sign in as the role named and try the thing directly.

- [ ] A resident cannot edit an official resident record
- [ ] A resident cannot edit a household
- [ ] A resident cannot approve their own verification
- [ ] A resident cannot allocate land or issue a PTO
- [ ] A resident cannot open staff messages
- [ ] A resident cannot open the audit trail
- [ ] A Registry Clerk cannot allocate land or issue a PTO
- [ ] A Registry Clerk cannot create council records
- [ ] A Registry Clerk cannot administer staff or read the audit trail
- [ ] A Land Officer cannot edit resident, household or lineage data
- [ ] A Land Officer cannot perform Secretary writes
- [ ] A Land Officer cannot administer staff or read the audit trail
- [ ] A Council Secretary cannot edit registry data
- [ ] A Council Secretary cannot allocate land or issue a PTO
- [ ] A Council Secretary cannot administer staff or read the audit trail
- [ ] A Council Administrator can administer staff, read the audit trail and transfer the role
- [ ] A Council Administrator can **not** do Registry, Land or Secretary writes
- [ ] Deactivating an account takes its access away within a minute, in an open window

## Session security

- [ ] A staff window left alone warns after 28 minutes and signs out at 30
- [ ] A resident window warns after 58 minutes and signs out at 60
- [ ] **Stay signed in** dismisses the warning and the session continues
- [ ] Clicking or typing before the warning prevents it appearing
- [ ] Leaving the page open and untouched does **not** keep the session alive
- [ ] The sign-out reaches every open tab
- [ ] The sign-in page then says "You were signed out after a period of inactivity."
- [ ] Manual sign out still works
- [ ] A timeout does not change any account's role, type or standing

To check these in seconds instead of half an hour, run `npm run dev`
and add `?idle-timeout=45` to any address. It is ignored in a
production build.

## Mobile and responsive

- [ ] No page scrolls sideways
- [ ] The navigation menu opens and closes, and every link is reachable

- [ ] No text is clipped or overflowing
- [ ] Focus is visible on every control when tabbing
- [ ] No page explains how the application works
- [ ] No page says "coming soon", "for now" or "placeholder"

## Error, loading and empty states

- [ ] Every page that loads data shows something while it loads
- [ ] A submit button disables itself while the action runs
- [ ] Submitting twice quickly does not do it twice
- [ ] A dropped connection says so in plain language
- [ ] No screen ever shows raw SQL, a stack trace or a Supabase object
- [ ] Every empty list says what is empty, not "No data"
- [ ] A duplicate identity number is refused readably
- [ ] Two people allocating the same site at once is refused readably
