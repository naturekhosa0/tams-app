# Getting around TAMS

Every route, who may open it, what it goes back to, and what home means
there. The rule behind all of it: **nobody should ever reach a screen and
have the browser's Back button as their only way out.**

---

## 1. The TAMS name is always the way home

The name in the header is a link.

* **Signed out** → the public landing page.
* **Signed in** → that person's own home, never somebody else's:

| Who | Home |
| --- | --- |
| Council Administrator | `/dashboard` |
| Registry Clerk | `/registry` |
| Land Officer | `/land` |
| Council Secretary | `/secretary` |
| Resident | `/resident` |
| Signed in with no access | `/no-access` |

## 2. Route inventory

## 3. The rules this follows

* **Every detail page** carries a contextual `← Back to …` naming the
  list it came from, as well as the navigation.
* **Every form** has a primary action and a **Cancel** that returns to a
  sensible parent, so nobody has to abandon a form with browser Back.
* **Every dialog** has Cancel beside its action. No dialog offers only a
  destructive choice.
* **Successful actions land somewhere useful** — a new message goes to
  that message, a sent notice to the sent list, an issued permission to
  its document, an approved application to the page where a site is
  allocated.
* **Breadcrumbs** appear on deeper pages, and every crumb is clickable.
* **The current section is marked** in the navigation.
* **Errors are never dead ends.** A record that is gone, a message that
  is not yours, an audit event that does not exist and an invalid PTO
  token each say so plainly and offer the list and the dashboard.
* **Unknown addresses** reach a Not Found page whose Home means that
  person's own dashboard, or the public landing page when signed out.
* **A link is never permission.** Navigation was made easier without a
  single policy being widened: the Registry Clerk who receives a link to
  a land application sees the reference, is told they cannot open it, and
  is offered the way back.

## 4. Small screens

Below 900px the navigation collapses into a **Menu** button. It exposes
every destination that role has, plus the notification bell, the account
and Sign out. Nothing is permanently hidden. The header's actions wrap
rather than run off the edge.

## 5. Accessibility

Navigation is real `<a>` and `<button>` elements with understandable
labels, reachable by keyboard, with a visible focus ring. The bell has an
accessible name that includes the unread count; the menu button carries
`aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`; breadcrumbs are a `<nav>` with the
current page marked `aria-current`.

## 6. Tests

`tests/navigation.test.ts` checks the rules that can be checked without a
browser, and reads `src/App.tsx` to compare them against the routes the
application actually serves:

* where each role's home is, signed in and signed out;
* that every role is offered Dashboard, Messages, Notifications and My
  account;
* that a resident is offered no staff area at all;
* that only the Council Administrator is offered the audit trail and the
  transfer;
* that **no role is offered another role's area**;
* that **every navigation link is a route that exists**, and so is every
  role's home;
* that a catch-all route exists and renders the Not Found page;
* that a permission can be checked with or without a reference;
* that no navigation offers the same destination twice.
